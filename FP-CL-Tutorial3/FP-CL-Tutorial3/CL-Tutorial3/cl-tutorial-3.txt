Exercise 1


All diligent students are successful.
All ignorant students are unsuccessful.
∴ Some diligent students are ignorant.

Not sound as there is no overlap on Venn diagram between A and C
as:

all a is b
no c is b
hence no a is c
It would be sound if No diligent students are ignorants


Every eagle can fly.
Some pigs cannot fly.
∴ Some pigs are not eagles.

This one is sound as can be derived from Barbara.
Also second line establishes a fact that there are some pigs (that do not overlap with other predicates on venn diagram - sign x)
As there is no overlap between a and c on Venn diagram the statement is sound

and isBig, isAmber |/= hasThickBorder

2. Some small thing is a disc
